## About me

Here's a litte about me:

- 🌐 Currently surviving an intensive Bootcamp for Web development at neue fische 
- 💡 Hopefully will  turn data into beautiful websites and apps
- 📚 Always on the quest for knowledge; my brain is a sponge, and tech is my favorite flavor.
- 🎓 Boasting a robust 20-year background in the hotel industry – because debugging code is a lot like managing a hotel: you fix problems, smile, and hope nobody notices the mess behind the scenes.
